yaourt-gui-mangaro  // GUI for manjaro

pacman -Syu     //Update all packages

yaourt -Ss package-name //search package

yaourt -Syu packag-name // to install all the packages in aur while updateing

yaourt -S package-name //Only install that package


For example, to install a package located in the Downloads folder, the following command would be entered:
sudo pacman -U ~/Downloads/[software package name.pkg.tar.xz]

Pacman usually also creates backup configuration files when deleting packages. As such, for a more thorough 
(and cleaner) removal (ie. the package, its dependencies, and any configuration files usually generated by pacman) enter the following command:
sudo pacman -Rns  //Remove package

clear the cache of downloads that have already been installed, enter the following command:
sudo pacman -Sc  //clean cache

Orphans
To list all orphans - that is, installed packages that are not used by anything else and that consequently serve no purpose - enter the following command:
pacman -Qdt

sudo pacman -Rs $(pacman -Qdtq) //To remove orphans


11.9 gb before cache removal
13.3 gb after cache removal
